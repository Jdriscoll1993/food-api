# food-api
# I've challenged myself to take this exercise a step further by implementing not only a "Get Food" button, but a "Get Drinks" button as well, which displays an entirely separate set of data from the same API. Users are able to toggle between the food and drink lists without stacking them on top of each other in the DOM. Tackling this was challenging, yet extremely rewarding and fun.
